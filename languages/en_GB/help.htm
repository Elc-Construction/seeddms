<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Parade's DMS (Document Management System) was created to allow employees to exchange valuable knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Using the navigation menu the user can access the various information stored in the system:
<ul>
<li>Add Memo: allows you to upload a new memo document.
<li>My documents: shows you a list of documents that you have created.
<li>Calendar: a calendar is included that serves as virtual bulletin board to share holidays, vacation days, site-wide appointments, and other general company-wide events. Once inserted, the events are public and visible to everyone. Only the administrator and who has entered the event can modify it later.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Cross-references</h2>
<p>
When a new memo is created, you have the option to cross-reference any other document that already exists in the system. Cross-references can be viewed in the Cross-reference tab when viewing a document. To add more than one cross-reference to the docuement, enter a comma-separated list of document numbers.
</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>
When a new memo is created, you have the option to include one or more parade employees in
notification list. When the memo is submitted or updated (a new version is submitted), 
everyone on the notification list will receive an email letting them know the document was updated.
The notification list can be modified when the document is updated. To add more than one employee to the notifiation list, enter a
comma-separated list of employee usernames.
</p>
